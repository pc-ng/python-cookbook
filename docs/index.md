# Python

Python is a popular and fastest-growing programming language in the world. It is used in variety of application developments, including web development, software development, and system scripting. 
For web development, Python can be used on server-side to create we applications; For software development, Python is used alongside software to create workflows.
We can create different scripts to facilitate different jobs, such as accessing the file systems, connecting to a remote database, handling arithmetic computations, etc.

Python is a versatile language that can be developed indepdent of the operating system of the developing platform. 
We can write the Python code in either procedural or object-oriented manner.
Below are some key features that make Python a popular language:

1. Easy to use
By emphasizing on natural language that can be understood by human, Python is the most accessible programming language with its simplified syntax.
Thanks to its simplicity in syntax, Python can be easily picked up by any people, even though you are amateur to programming.

2. Supportive community
Python is supported by a large group of developers all levels ranging from beginner to expert levels. 
Learning Python is always easy as there are plenty of documentation and tutorials available both online and offline. 

3. Diverse Python Libraries
Python has excellent libraries that we can use for our own development. There are many useful libraries, for example:

    1. scikit-learn for machine learning
    2. matplotlib for graph plotting
    3. NumPy for scientific computing
    4. SciPy for applied Science and Mathematics 

4. Big data and Machine Learning
Python is the widely used programming language for problems related to big data and machine learning. 
Many data processing workloads and research utilize Python to analyze and organize large-scale data.

5. Automation
Building an automation tool with Python is easy by using existing Python modules. 
Python is also the best performance booster in the automation of software testing.
